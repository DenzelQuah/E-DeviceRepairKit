Widget
Definition Stateful/Stateless: Decide if the overall state/view can or cannot be change

eg: Let say i create box view page
 Flow: Create a page
 CREATE Stateful/Stateless is basically create a box.
                main > runApp
                    |
                Box(i created)
                    |
                datatype (variable)
                    |
            return MaterialApp (widget for theming,appbar,dashboard...)
                    |
                 Scaffold
                    |
                  AppBar
                    |
                   Body





Constraint/Const: The widget or value never changes, so Flutter can build it once and reuse it forever
-> It doesn’t depend on any variables, user input, or runtime data.
